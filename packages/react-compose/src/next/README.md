# @fluentui/react-compose

`@fluentui/react-compose` is a library of utilities for composing Fluent UI components.

## A basic component walkthrough

Building a recomposable component requires that we build legos; we put them together, but we let others put them together how they may need. Here's what's needed:

- **State hooks** - all processing of the component should be done within one or more reusable hooks. The hooks should be allowed to manipulate the state in some reusable way, so that recomposing the component can be easily done.
- **Render function** - a function which takes in final state and returns JSX. (e.g. `renderButton`)
- **Component factory function** - a create function which returns `{ state, render }` parts for creating the component. This is used to scaffold a new version of the component as needed.
- **Style hooks** - hooks which can take in styles and provide appropriate classnames to the anatomy of the component.

With these building blocks, you can compose or recompose the component in numerous ways.

### Simple example

A render function:

```jsx
const renderButton = state => {
  return <button {...state} />;
};
```

A hook which can manipulate the state (defining accessibility and behaviors):

```jsx
const useButtonState = state => {
  // If the button is rendered as something besides a button or anchor, make it focusable.
  if (state.as !== 'button' && state.as !== 'a') {
    state.tabIndex = 0;
  }
};
```

A factory function sets up the state and render function:

```jsx
const useButton = (userProps, ref, defaultProps) => {
  const state = _.merge({}, defaultProps, userProps);

  // Apply button behaviors.
  useButtonState(state);

  return { state, render: renderButton };
};
```

A button can now be easily scaffolded, along with your choice of styling systems:

```jsx
import * as styles from './Button.scss';

const useStyles = makeStyles(styles);

const Button = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { state, render } = createButton(props, ref);

  // Inject classNames as needed.
  useStyles(state);

  return render(state);
});
```

We can also use these building blocks to scaffold other types of buttons, transform input, pull values from
context, redefine styling, or mix/match behaviors:

```jsx
const ToggleButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { state, render } = createButton(props, ref);

  // Hand a "checked" and "defaultChecked" state, onClicks to toggle the value,
  // and appropriate a11y attributes.
  useChecked(state);

  // Inject classNames as needed.
  useStyles(state);

  return render(state);

```

### Details

#### Creating mutable state with `mergeProps`

In the previous example, `_.merge` was used to deep clone the props into a state object. Creating a single clone and using that to construct state simplifies hook development and usage; rather than trying to re-clone objects unnecessarily on every small mutation, hooks can assume operating against a draft state. This creates more self contained hooks, which can ensure they apply state updates correctly, avoiding accidents like stomping on existing event handlers by blind object assigning the results.

However, deep merge overlooks many edge cases for component props:

- Deep merging classnames should append them, not replace
- Deep merging JSX, ref objects, or arrays should replace, not recurse/clone
- Deep merging an object on a string should replace

...which introduces the first utility: `mergeProps`. Merge props works like a deep merge, but takes care of classnames, JSX, arrays, and object edge cases.

#### Supporting the `as` prop with `getSlots`

Fluent UI components take a common `as` prop. This allows the root element to be rendered with something other than the default.

To support the `as` prop, the render function might look like this:

```jsx
const renderButton = state => {
  const root = state.as;

  return <root {...state} />;
};
```

Additionally, you will need to filter out native properties which apply to the root; otherwise you will end up mixing any unexpected props into the element. To do this, we have a `getNativeElementProps` helper, which can be used for this purpose:

```jsx
const renderButton = state => {
  const root = state.as;
  const rootProps = getNativeElementProps(root, state);

  return <root {...rootProps} />;
};
```

These steps have been abstracted in the `getSlots` helper:

```jsx
const renderButton = state => {
  const { slots, slotProps } = getSlots(state);

  return <slots.root {...slotProps.root} />;
};
```

#### Supporting shorthand props

Fluent UI components almost always contain sub parts, and these sub parts should be configurable. We allow them to be configured through "shorthand props", which lets the caller pass in a variety of inputs for a given slot. Take a Button's "icon" slot:

```jsx
// The icon can be a string
<Button icon="X" />

// The icon can be JSX
<Button icon={ <FooIcon/> }/>

// The icon can be an object
<Button icon={{ as: 'i', children: getCode('Add') } } />

// The icon can be a children function (which receives the original slot and props)
<Button icon={{
  children: (Component, props) =>
      <>
         <Component {...props} />
         //  other things
      </>
   }}
/>
```

Supporting this dynamic props input requires some helpers:

1. A helper `simplifyShorthand` to simplify the user's input into an object for props merging
2. The `getSlots` helper to parse the slots out

Here's how this looks:

The factory function, which deep clones the props, would need to simplify the shorthand first:

```jsx
const createButton = (userProps, ref, defaultProps) => {
  const state = mergeProps(
    {
      // default props
      as: 'button',
      ref,
      icon: { as: 'span' },
    },
    defaultProps, // optional default props from the caller
    simplifyShorthand(userProps, ['icon']), // simplify the user's props
  );

  // Apply button behaviors.
  useButton(state);

  return { state, render };
};
```

...and the render function now can manage rendering the slot using getSlots:

```jsx
const renderButton = state => {
  const { slots, slotProps } = getSlots(state, ['icon']);

  return (
    <slots.root {...slotProps.root}>
      <slots.icon {...slotProps.icon} />
      {state.children}
    </slots.root>
  );
};
```

## API reference

### mergeProps(target, ...rest)

The `mergeProps` function takes in state and compose options, and resolves slots and slotProps.
It's expected that the component will call `mergeProps(state, options)` from within
render; after resolving state and before rendering slots and slotProps.

Example:

```jsx
mergeProps(props, { ...etc }, { ...etc });
```

### getSlots(state: Record<string, any>, slotNames: string[])

The `getSlots` function takes in a state object and a list of slot keys with the state, and returns
`slots` and `slotProps` to be used in rendering the component.

`slotProps` are calculated based on.

It will also assume that the `as` prop represents the intrinsic element tag name. This will be used
in determining the `root` slot value and the appropriate filtered `rootProps` for the `root` slot.

Example:

```jsx
const Button = props => {
  const { slots, slotProps } = getSlots(props, ['foo', 'bar']);

  return (
    <slots.root { slotProps.root}>
      <slots.foo { slotProps.foo } />
      <slots.bar { slotProps.foo } />
    </slots.root>
  );
};
```

### simplifyShorthand<TState>(state: TState, slotNames: (keyof TState)[]): TState

Ensures that the given slots are represented using object syntax. This ensures that
the object can be merged along with other objects.

Example:

```jsx
const foo = simplifyShorthand(
  { a: <JSX/>, b: 'string', c: { ... }, d: 'unchanged' },
  [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
);
```

Results in objects which can be merged correctly:

```jsx
{
  a: { children: <JSX/> },
  b: { children: 'string' },
  c: { ... },
  d: 'unchanged'
}
```
